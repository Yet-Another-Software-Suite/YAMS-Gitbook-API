# GearBox

**Package:** `yams.gearing`

`GearBox` models a multi-stage gear reduction. Each stage reduces or increases speed by a fixed ratio. Multiple stages are combined by multiplication.

A "reduction" in YAMS means motor rotations per one mechanism rotation. A 5:1 reduction means the motor spins 5 times for each mechanism rotation.

## Constructors

```java
GearBox(double[] reductionStage)
GearBox(String[] reductionStage)   // "IN:OUT" format per stage
```

## Factory Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `static GearBox fromReductionStages(double... reductionStages)` | Creates a `GearBox` from one or more numeric ratios. Each ratio is motor-rotations per mechanism-rotation for that stage. |
| `static GearBox fromStages(String... stages)` | Creates from stage strings in `"IN:OUT"` format, where `IN` is the driving gear tooth count and `OUT` is the driven. |
| `static GearBox fromTeeth(int... teeth)` | Creates from alternating tooth counts: `driver1, driven1, driver2, driven2, ...`. Each pair is one stage. |

## Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getInputToOutputConversionFactor()` | `double` | Returns `OUT/IN` — mechanism rotations per motor rotation. For a 5:1 box, returns `0.2`. |
| `getOutputToInputConversionFactor()` | `double` | Returns `IN/OUT` — motor rotations per mechanism rotation. For a 5:1 box, returns `5.0`. |
| `times(double x)` | `GearBox` | Multiplies the reduction ratio by `x`. Returns the same `GearBox` for chaining. |
| `div(double x)` | `GearBox` | Divides the reduction ratio by `x`. Returns the same `GearBox` for chaining. |

## Expressing the Same Reduction Three Ways

All three of the following produce an equivalent 5.14:1 reduction:

```java
// From explicit reduction ratio
GearBox g1 = GearBox.fromReductionStages(5.142857);

// From "IN:OUT" stage strings
GearBox g2 = GearBox.fromStages("12:62");

// From tooth counts (driver then driven for each stage)
GearBox g3 = GearBox.fromTeeth(12, 62);
```

For a two-stage gearbox (12T → 48T, then 16T → 64T):

```java
GearBox twoStage = GearBox.fromTeeth(12, 48, 16, 64);
// Equivalent to: (48/12) × (64/16) = 4.0 × 4.0 = 16:1
```
