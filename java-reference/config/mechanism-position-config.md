# MechanismPositionConfig

**Package:** `yams.core.mechanisms.config`

`MechanismPositionConfig` places a mechanism on the robot: where it is mounted, how it is turned there, the plane it moves in, and the mechanism it is mounted on, if any. Each mechanism's `getPose3d()` is worked out from it, to publish as a component of an AdvantageScope robot model. It also sizes and places the mechanism's `Mechanism2d` in simulation. All builder methods return the `MechanismPositionConfig` for chaining.

Give it to a mechanism with `withMechanismPositionConfig(...)` on [ArmConfig](arm-config.md), [ElevatorConfig](elevator-config.md), [PivotConfig](pivot-config.md), [FlyWheelConfig](flywheel-config.md) or [DifferentialMechanismConfig](differential-mechanism-config.md).

## Coordinates

Positions are in meters from the robot's origin, which AdvantageScope puts at the center of the robot, on the floor: +X forward, +Y left and +Z up.

A part that turns, such as an arm, a pivot or a flywheel, turns about the axis normal to its movement plane:

| Plane            | At 0, the part points | A positive angle turns it | Example                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `XZ` (default)   | +X, forward           | Toward +Z, up             | An arm that swings over the front           |
| `YZ`             | +Y, left              | Toward +Z, up             | An arm that swings over the side            |
| `XY`             | +X, forward           | Toward +Y, left           | A turret. A `Pivot`'s default               |

A part that slides, such as an elevator's carriage, moves along its angle in the movement plane: 0 along +X (+Y in the YZ plane), 90° along +Z (+Y in the XY plane).

## Constructor

```java
MechanismPositionConfig()
```

The movement plane is XZ. A `PivotConfig` gives its pivot an XY plane unless you give it your own `MechanismPositionConfig`.

## Builder methods

| Method                                            | Parameters                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `withRelativePosition(Translation3d robotToMechanism)` | `robotToMechanism`: where it is mounted   | Where the mechanism is mounted, from the robot, or from its parent: an arm's or pivot's axis, an elevator's carriage at zero height, or a flywheel's axle.        |
| `withRelativePosition(Transform3d robotToMechanism)`   | `robotToMechanism`: where, and how turned | Also sets how the mechanism is turned where it is mounted, such as an arm on the side of the robot facing left.                                                   |
| `withParent(Supplier<Pose3d> parentPose)`         | `parentPose`: the pose it is mounted on        | Mounts the mechanism on another, such as an arm on `elevator::getPose3d`, so it moves with it. Its relative position is then from the parent's pose.               |
| `withMovementPlane(Plane plane)`                  | `plane`: `XZ`, `YZ` or `XY`                    | The plane the mechanism moves in. Default `XZ`.                                                                                                                   |
| `withMaxRobotLength(Distance robotLength)`        | `robotLength`: the robot's length              | Sizes the `Mechanism2d` window. Defaults to twice the mechanism's length.                                                                                         |
| `withMaxRobotHeight(Distance robotHeight)`        | `robotHeight`: the robot's height              | Sizes the `Mechanism2d` window. Defaults to twice the mechanism's length.                                                                                         |

## Poses

These do the math for each mechanism's `getPose3d()`, and can place a part YAMS has no mechanism for.

| Method                                         | Returns         | Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getMountPose()`                               | `Pose3d`        | Where the mechanism is mounted: its parent's pose, or the robot's origin, moved and turned by its relative position. |
| `getRotatedPose(Angle angle)`                  | `Pose3d`        | The mount pose, turned by the angle about the axis normal to the movement plane.                    |
| `getTranslatedPose(Distance distance, Angle angle)` | `Pose3d`   | The mount pose, moved by the distance along the angle in the movement plane, and not turned.        |
| `rotationInPlane(Angle angle)`                 | `Rotation3d`    | The rotation of the angle about the axis normal to the movement plane.                              |

## Getters

| Method                  | Returns                   | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getRelativePosition()` | `Optional<Translation3d>` | Where the mechanism is mounted, or empty if not set.     |
| `getMovementPlane()`    | `Plane`                   | The plane the mechanism moves in.                       |

## Example

```java
// An elevator 0.1 m behind the robot's center, its carriage 0.15 m off the floor at zero height.
Elevator elevator = new Elevator(new ElevatorConfig()
    // ...
    .withMechanismPositionConfig(new MechanismPositionConfig()
        .withRelativePosition(new Translation3d(-0.1, 0, 0.15))), elevatorMotor);

// An arm on the carriage, its axis 0.2 m above it. It moves with the carriage.
Arm arm = new Arm(new ArmConfig()
    // ...
    .withMechanismPositionConfig(new MechanismPositionConfig()
        .withParent(elevator::getPose3d)
        .withRelativePosition(new Translation3d(0, 0, 0.2))), armMotor);

Telemetry.log("Robot/Components", new Pose3d[] {elevator.getPose3d(), arm.getPose3d()}, Pose3d.struct);
```
