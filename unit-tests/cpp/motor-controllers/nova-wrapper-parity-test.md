# NovaWrapperParityTest

**Group:** [motor-controllers](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/native/cpp/NovaWrapperParityTest.cpp`\
**Tags:** `[NovaParity]`

Checks that the C++ `NovaWrapper` behaves like the Java `NovaWrapper`: the same config options are accepted or rejected, encoders read the same values, and the closed loop, gains, soft limits and wrapping go to the Thrifty Nova in the same cases.

## Setup

- Each test builds a new Thrifty Nova (and a Thrifty CAN encoder where needed) driving a NEO, on a CAN bus no other test uses.
- The base config has a 12:1 gearing, a 40 A stator current limit, brake mode and closed loop mode.
- In simulation the Nova runs the closed loop in its `NovaSimSupplier`, so tests step it with `SimIterate()`. Tests that read back a value sent to the Nova retry for up to 0.5 s.
- A closed loop period of 1 ms means the Nova runs the loop; 20 ms means the SystemCore runs it.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `NovaParity.ClosedLoopConvergesInSimulation` | With kP, a kV feedforward and a trapezoidal profile, a setpoint of 80 degrees is reached within 2 degrees after 3 s. |
| `NovaParity.SimulationHoldsCommandedDutyCycle` | `SetVoltage(6_V)` gives a duty cycle of 6 V over the battery voltage, and it stays the same over 25 sim steps. Duty cycle is clamped to [-1, 1] and the voltage never goes above the battery voltage. |
| `NovaParity.VendorConfigMustBeNovaConfigBatch` | A vendor config that is not a `NovaConfigBatch` throws, and a `NovaConfigBatch` is accepted. |
| `NovaParity.UnsupportedOptionsThrow` | Building the wrapper throws for: an inverted internal encoder; different open and closed loop ramp rates (matching ones are accepted); a zero offset without an external encoder; a zero offset on a quadrature encoder; an external encoder that is not a data port or CAN encoder; a vendor control request. |
| `NovaParity.AbsoluteEncodersReportTheWrappingRange` | Runs once with the data port absolute encoder and once with a CAN encoder. With continuous wrapping over [-0.5, 0.5), an encoder position of 0.7 reads -0.3 on the mechanism and external encoder, while the motor's encoder still reads 0.7. |
| `NovaParity.ExternalEncoderGearing` | A quadrature encoder with a 2:1 gearing is not wrapped: 3 rotations reads 3 on the mechanism and 36 on the rotor. |
| `NovaParity.CanEncoderReadsTheSimulatedMechanism` | In simulation the CAN encoder reads the mechanism through its 2:1 gearing (0.6 and 3.0 on the encoder), and the wrapper reports 0.3 rotations and 1.5 rot/s. |
| `NovaParity.StartingPosition` | A starting position of 45 degrees reads 0.125 rotations on the mechanism and 1.5 on the rotor. |
| `NovaParity.FollowersMustBeNovasAndAreCleared` | A follower that is not a Nova throws. A Nova follower is set up and then cleared from the config, so applying the config again does not reconfigure it. |
| `NovaParity.LiveSettersUpdateConfig` | `SetKp`, `SetKd`, `SetKs` and `SetKv` update the YAMS config and the Nova's slot 0. `SetEncoderInverted` throws. |
| `NovaParity.ClosedLoopOnTheNova` | What the Nova runs and what the SystemCore runs. Sections: gains and motion profile reach the Nova in mechanism rotations; a feedforward without a motion profile still runs on the Nova (with kS, kA, and with a profile); a temperature cutoff throws; the closed loop tolerance is the allowable error of every slot with a PID; gains in slot 2 throw, since the Nova has two slots; mechanism limits become the Nova's soft limits; wrapping runs on the Nova where it can, and a non-continuous wrapping range other than [0, 1) on an absolute encoder runs on the SystemCore. |

## Run it
