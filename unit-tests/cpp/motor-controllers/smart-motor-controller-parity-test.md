# SmartMotorControllerParityTest

**Group:** [motor-controllers](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/native/cpp/SmartMotorControllerParityTest.cpp`\
**Tags:** `[SMCParity]`

Checks that the C++ `SmartMotorController`, `SmartMotorControllerConfig` and simulation suppliers behave like the Java ones. It covers how the simulation is stepped, the battery simulation, software PID and wrapping, velocity profiles, feedforward force, unit conversions, config builders and telemetry.

## Setup

- Most tests use `FakeSmartMotorController`, a fake motor controller from the test helpers, so no vendor hardware is involved.
- Simulation tests wrap a Kraken X60 `DCMotorSim` (or a `SingleJointedArmSim`) in a `DCMotorSimSupplier` (or `ArmSimSupplier`).
- Telemetry tests publish to the `SMCParity/Data` and `SMCParity/Tuning` NetworkTables.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `SMCParity.SimSteppedOncePerLoop` | When the mechanism and the motor controller both call `UpdateSim()` in the same loop, the simulation still steps only once. After 5 loops at 6 V, the velocity matches a reference `DCMotorSim` stepped once per 20 ms. |
| `SMCParity.SupplierUsesSimulationPeriod` | The default simulation period is 20 ms. With `WithSimulationPeriod(5_ms)`, one `UpdateSim()` at 12 V matches a reference sim stepped 5 ms. |
| `SMCParity.SupplierTracksFilteredSupplyCurrentUnderController` | Supply current is the duty cycle times the stator current, through a 0.1 s filter. When the voltage is fed in, the battery sim does not record the controller's current. When it is not fed in, the battery sim records it. `Close()` removes it. |
| `SMCParity.BatterySimReset` | `BatterySim::Reset()` clears every recorded current draw. |
| `SMCParity.BatterySimIsThreadSafe` | 8 threads add and remove current draws 20,000 times each at once. Afterwards nothing is left loading the battery, so it reads 12 V. |
| `SMCParity.ArmSupplierReportsAcceleration` | `ArmSimSupplier` reports a positive rotor acceleration at 12 V, and the mechanism acceleration is the rotor acceleration divided by the 10:1 gearing. |
| `SMCParity.SoftwarePIDWrapsAndHasTolerance` | With continuous wrapping and a closed loop tolerance, the software PID has continuous input on and an error tolerance of 0.01 rotations. |
| `SMCParity.ContinuousWrappingSetpoint` | `GetContinuousWrappingSetpoint` returns the setpoint unchanged without wrapping. With continuous wrapping over [-0.5, 0.5) it picks the nearest equal setpoint to the current position (for example 0.4 from -0.4 gives -0.6, and 0.1 from 3.0 gives 3.1). |
| `SMCParity.WrappingIsNotContinuous` | `WithWrapping` sets the wrapping range but is not continuous: the setpoint is not moved, the software PID has continuous input off, and soft limits are still allowed. |
| `SMCParity.ZeroPowerIsOptional` | The zero power mode is empty until set, then reads back as `BRAKE`. |
| `SMCParity.VelocityTrapezoidProfileTakesAccelerationAndJerk` | `WithVelocityTrapezoidProfile` takes a max acceleration and jerk, and the velocity setpoint ramps so the first loop's output is small (between 0 and 0.1 V). Sections: `angular` (with a kV feedforward) and `linear` (with a PID, in meters). |
| `SMCParity.VelocityProfileJerkTuningDefault` | The live tuning `maxJerk` entry starts at the configured jerk in RPM/s² (10 rot/s³ is 600). |
| `SMCParity.VelocityFeedforwardForceAddedInLoop` | `SetVelocity(0_tps, 10_N)` stores the force and the closed loop adds the voltage a Kraken X60 needs for that force through a 0.1 m circumference. `ConvertToVoltage` and `ConvertToCurrent` agree, and they throw without a circumference. |
| `SMCParity.SetpointForceTelemetry` | The setpoint force is published to `closedloop/setpoint/force`. |
| `SMCParity.DistanceConversions` | `ConvertToMechanism` turns distance, velocity, acceleration and jerk into rotations using the circumference, and `ConvertFromMechanism` goes back. It throws without a circumference. |
| `SMCParity.ConfigBuilders` | Config builders work like Java. Sections: feedback synchronization threshold is rotational only; closed loop tolerance needs a PID and matching units; voltage compensation and reset previous config; telemetry with only a verbosity is named `motor`; linear closed loop controller flag; zero offset as a distance; gearing from a ratio and cascading elevator stages; simulation LQR override; clear followers; new options are tracked for validation. |
| `SMCParity.TelemetryConfigFromConfig` | A custom `SmartMotorControllerTelemetryConfig` publishes only the fields it enables (mechanism position and rotor velocity), and the verbosity becomes `HIGH`. |
| `SMCParity.ApplyTuningValues` | Changing the tuned `kP` in NetworkTables and calling `ApplyTuningValues()` sets kP on the motor controller once. |
| `SMCParity.CloseHooksRunOnce` | A close hook runs once, even when `Close()` is called twice and the destructor runs. |
| `SMCParity.SetMechanismGearingAndCircumference` | `SetMechanismGearing` and `SetMechanismCircumference` update the motor controller's config. |
