# SmartMotorControllerRegressionTest

**Group:** [motor-controllers](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/native/cpp/SmartMotorControllerRegressionTest.cpp`\
**Tags:** `[SMCRegression]`

Regression tests for places where the C++ `SmartMotorController` and `SmartMotorControllerConfig` used to behave differently from Java. Each test only uses API that existed before the fix, so it fails on the old code and passes on the fixed code.

## Setup

- Most tests use `FakeSmartMotorController`, a fake motor controller from the test helpers. One test builds a real simulated SPARK MAX.
- Closed loop tests run with an `EnabledRobot` and call `IterateClosedLoopController()` once, then read the voltage the fake controller was given.
- Telemetry tests publish to the `SMCRegression/Data` and `SMCRegression/Tuning` NetworkTables. Live Tuning tests use a `TestSubsystem`.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `SMCRegression.WrapperConfigUsedByBaseSafetyCheck` | A `SparkWrapper` for a NEO 550 with a 30 A stator current limit builds without throwing. This only passes if the base class reads the wrapper's config, not its own empty copy. |
| `SMCRegression.UpdateTelemetryDoesNotApplyTuning` | Publishing telemetry does not apply a kP typed on the dashboard. Only the Live Tuning command applies it. |
| `SMCRegression.SetupTelemetryPublishesImmediately` | `SetupTelemetry` publishes the mechanism position right away, without waiting for an update. |
| `SMCRegression.CloseRemovesLiveTuningCommand` | Setting up telemetry registers the `Live Tuning` command on the subsystem, and `Close()` removes it. |
| `SMCRegression.MechanismTelemetryRegistersLiveTuning` | `MechanismTelemetry` registers `Live Tuning` for the motor it sets up. Sections: single motor mechanism; multi motor mechanism; low verbosity does not register it. |
| `SMCRegression.LiveTuningVoltage` | Turning on the tuning voltage stops the closed loop and starts at 0 V. The typed voltage then drives the motor and its loosely coupled follower every loop, and a new setpoint is ignored while it is on. Sections: turning it off hands back to the closed loop and the old setpoint; ending the Live Tuning command stops the voltage and turns it off. |
| `SMCRegression.RemoveCommandsUnpublishesTunable` | `RemoveCommands` removes the command's entries from the `Tuning` NetworkTable. |
| `SMCRegression.LinearModeNeedsLinearIndicator` | A circumference alone does not make the closed loop linear. Sections: circumference alone is rotational; an elevator feedforward makes it linear; a linear trapezoidal profile makes it linear; a linear indicator without a circumference is rotational. |
| `SMCRegression.ProfiledFeedforwardIncludesKa` | With a trapezoidal profile, the feedforward includes kA: from rest at 2 rot/s², kA of 1 gives about 2 V. |
| `SMCRegression.ContinuousWrappingTakesShortestPath` | With continuous wrapping over [-0.5, 0.5), going from 0.45 to -0.45 takes the 0.1 rotation path across the wrap point, and the measurement crossing the wrap point does not make the output jump. |
| `SMCRegression.MeasurementLimitsBecomeMechanismLimits` | `WithMeasurementLimits` sets the mechanism limits. Sections: converted with the circumference (0.5 m and 1 m on a 2 m circumference give 0.25 and 0.5 rotations); throws without a circumference. |
| `SMCRegression.LinearExponentialProfileIsFollowed` | With a linear exponential profile, the PID chases the profile's first step, not the 1 m goal, so the output stays under 0.5 V. |
| `SMCRegression.LinearTrapezoidStateResetOnStart` | Starting the closed loop resets the linear trapezoidal profile state to the current position (2 m). |
| `SMCRegression.FeedforwardAppliedForVelocitySetpoint` | Elevator and arm feedforwards are applied for a velocity setpoint, not only for a position one. Sections: elevator (kG gives 1 V); elevator kV times the velocity setpoint (2 times 0.5 m/s gives 1 V); arm (kG gives 1 V). |
| `SMCRegression.ConvertFromMechanismRequiresCircumference` | `ConvertFromMechanism` throws without a circumference, and with 0.5 m turns 2 rotations into 1 m. |
| `SMCRegression.DefaultMomentOfInertia` | The default moment of inertia is 0.02 kg·m². |
| `SMCRegression.InversionIgnoredInSimulation` | In simulation, motor and external encoder inversion read back as not inverted. |
| `SMCRegression.DrumExponentialProfileSetsMaxInput` | An exponential profile built from a motor, mass and drum radius sets the max input voltage (10 V). |
| `SMCRegression.ConfigValidation` | Config builders reject bad values. Sections: continuous wrapping needs a closed loop controller; lower limit must be below upper limit; a negative zero offset wraps by one rotation (-0.25 becomes 0.75); the subsystem may only be set once; an unset subsystem throws. |
| `SMCRegression.ExponentialProfileTuningDefaults` | The live tuning entries for the exponential profile's kV, kA and max input start at the configured values. |
| `SMCRegression.SynchronizeBeforeRunningCheck` | The closed loop synchronizes the encoders even when the controller is not running. |
