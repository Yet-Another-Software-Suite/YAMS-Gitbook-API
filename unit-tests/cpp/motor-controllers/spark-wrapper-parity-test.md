# SparkWrapperParityTest

**Group:** [motor-controllers](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/native/cpp/SparkWrapperParityTest.cpp`\
**Tags:** `[SparkParity]`

Checks that the C++ `SparkWrapper` sends the same values to a SPARK as the Java `SparkWrapper` does. A SPARK works in motor rotations, motor RPM and duty cycle, so the tests check that gains, setpoints, profile limits, soft limits, tolerances and wrapping are converted from YAMS mechanism units correctly. Each test also passes only on the fixed code, so it would catch the old bug.

## Setup

- Each test builds a new simulated SPARK MAX driving a NEO (one test uses a Minion), on CAN bus `CAN_S1` with its own CAN ID.
- The base config has a 12:1 gearing, a 40 A stator current limit, brake mode and closed loop mode.
- Values are read back from the SPARK's applied configuration (`configAccessor`), retrying for up to 1 s since they apply in the background. Each test resets the SPARK to defaults at the end.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `SparkParity.GainsInFeedbackSensorUnits` | kP, kI and kD are divided by 12 V times the gearing (volts per mechanism rotation become duty cycle per motor rotation). kS is sent as is; kV and kA are converted to volts per motor RPM. Setting the encoder to 0.25 rotations puts 3 motor rotations on the SPARK. |
| `SparkParity.VoltageCompensationAppliedAndScalesGains` | Voltage compensation of 10 V is turned on and set, and kP is divided by 10 V instead of 12 V. |
| `SparkParity.ArmFeedforwardCosineRatio` | With an arm feedforward, kCos is 0 in simulation (the wrapper sends gravity itself) and the kCos ratio is 1 over the gearing. `SetKg` keeps both and updates kG in the YAMS config. |
| `SparkParity.SetpointsAndGainsSwitchUnits` | A velocity of 1 rot/s is sent as 720 motor RPM, with kP 60 times smaller. A position of 0.5 rotations is sent as 6 motor rotations, with the position kP. |
| `SparkParity.MAXMotionConstraintsInFeedbackSensorRPM` | The trapezoidal profile's max velocity and acceleration go to MAXMotion in motor RPM and RPM/s. The live setters update both the YAMS config and the SPARK. |
| `SparkParity.SimulatedMAXMotionFollowsProfile` | In simulation the wrapper follows the profile with position control: the first setpoint is a small step, and the mechanism reaches 1 rotation within 0.05 after 3 s. |
| `SparkParity.SimulatedProfileAppliesKsOnce` | While following a profile on a mechanism too heavy to move, the applied voltage is kS (0.5 V), not twice kS. |
| `SparkParity.SimulatedProfileAppliesKa` | While following a profile, kA times the profile's acceleration is applied (1 V). |
| `SparkParity.SimulatedArmGravityFollowsTheAngle` | Holding an arm at 60 and 150 degrees, with and without a profile, applies kG times the cosine of the arm's angle. |
| `SparkParity.SoftLimitsInFeedbackSensorRotations` | Mechanism limits become soft limits in motor rotations, and `SetMechanismLimits`, `SetMechanismUpperLimit` and `SetMechanismLowerLimit` update them. |
| `SparkParity.ClosedLoopToleranceInFeedbackSensorRotations` | The closed loop tolerance becomes the allowed closed loop error and allowed profile error in motor rotations. |
| `SparkParity.SetMechanismGearingRewritesScaledValues` | Changing the gearing to 6:1 rewrites kP and the soft limits for the new gearing. |
| `SparkParity.AbsoluteEncoderRangeOffset` | The absolute encoder's range offset is the middle of the wrapping range: 0 for [-0.5, 0.5) and 0.5 for [0, 1). |
| `SparkParity.ExternalFeedbackReadsExternalEncoder` | With the absolute encoder as feedback and a 2:1 encoder gearing, the SPARK's feedback sensor is the absolute encoder, and 0.4 encoder rotations reads 0.2 mechanism rotations. |
| `SparkParity.AbsoluteEncoderSeedsMotorEncoder` | Without a starting position, the motor's encoder starts from the absolute encoder, in motor rotations. |
| `SparkParity.SynchronizeRelativeEncoderFromAbsolute` | When the motor's encoder is more than the threshold away from the absolute encoder, `SynchronizeRelativeEncoder()` reseeds it in motor rotations. |
| `SparkParity.SetEncoderPositionSendsAbsoluteZeroOffset` | `SetEncoderPosition` on an absolute encoder sends a zero offset in [0, 1). |
| `SparkParity.QuadratureAndDetachedEncoders` | Sections: Alternate encoder (feedback sensor is the alternate encoder and it reads back the set position); Detached encoder (feedback sensor is the detached absolute encoder, and 0.7 rotations reads -0.3 with wrapping over [-0.5, 0.5)). |
| `SparkParity.ContinuousWrappingRangeInFeedbackRotations` | Sections: motor encoder feedback wraps over the range in motor rotations (-5 to 5 at 10:1) and the setpoint is sent as is; absolute encoder feedback wraps in encoder rotations (-0.5 to 0.5); an absolute encoder set but not used wraps in motor rotations; no continuous wrapping turns the SPARK's wrapping off. |
| `SparkParity.UnsupportedOptionsThrow` | Building the wrapper throws for each section: supply current limit; relative encoder inversion; closed loop control period, max voltage, or feedback synchronization threshold without a RoboRIO controller; temperature cutoff without a profile; temperature cutoff with a trapezoidal profile (which runs on the SPARK); unknown follower type. |
| `SparkParity.SupplyCurrentIsUnsupported` | `GetSupplyCurrent()` returns nothing. |
| `SparkParity.ResetPreviousConfig` | With `WithResetPreviousConfig(false)`, the SPARK keeps its previous 33 A current limit. |
| `SparkParity.MinionAdvancesCommutation` | A Minion motor sets the advance commutation to 120. |
| `SparkParity.FollowersGetIdleModeAndAreCleared` | A follower SPARK follows the leader's CAN ID and gets brake mode, and the followers are cleared from the config so applying it again does not reconfigure them. |
| `SparkParity.LiveSettersScaleUpdateConfigAndForward` | `SetKp` and `SetKv` scale the gain for the SPARK, update the YAMS config, and forward kP to a loosely coupled follower. Setting duty cycle 0 also stops the follower. |
| `SparkParity.SimulationInputs` | A voltage command drives the mechanism simulation directly, stator current comes from the simulation, and the simulated encoder velocity is set in motor RPM. |
