# MechanismPoseTest

**Group:** [other](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/native/cpp/MechanismPoseTest.cpp`\
**Tags:** `[MechanismPose]`

Checks the 3D pose each mechanism reports from `GetPose3d()`, against poses worked out by hand. It covers where a mechanism is mounted, how its motor's position turns or moves it, each movement plane, a turned mount, and a mechanism mounted on another. It mirrors the Java `MechanismPoseTest`.

## Setup

- The first six tests only use `MechanismPositionConfig`, with no motor controller.
- The other tests build one simulated SPARK MAX with a 10:1 reduction and a starting position, then build the mechanism on it and read its pose. Positions are checked to within 1e-6 m.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `MechanismPose.ArmInTheXzPlaneTurnsUpTowardZ` | A mount at (0.2, 0, 0.5) in the default XZ plane: the end of a 1 m arm is at (1.2, 0, 0.5) when level, (0.2, 0, 1.5) at 90 degrees, and below the pivot at -30 degrees. |
| `MechanismPose.ArmInTheYzPlaneTurnsFromYUpTowardZ` | In the YZ plane, a 1 m arm points along +Y when level and along +Z at 90 degrees. |
| `MechanismPose.TurretInTheXyPlaneTurnsFromXTowardY` | In the XY plane at 0.4 m up, a turret turned 90 degrees points along +Y and turned 180 degrees points along -X. |
| `MechanismPose.ElevatorSlidesAlongItsAngle` | An upright elevator mounted 0.1 m up puts a 0.7 m carriage at 0.8 m with no rotation. Leaning 30 degrees forward (60 degrees), the carriage moves forward and up along that angle. |
| `MechanismPose.TurnedMountTurnsTheMechanism` | An arm mounted on the robot's left side and turned 90 degrees to face left has its level end at (0, 1.3, 0.5), and its upright end at (0, 0.3, 1.5). |
| `MechanismPose.MechanismOnAnotherMovesWithIt` | An arm mounted on an elevator's carriage moves up with the carriage: its pivot goes from 0.7 m to 1.2 m when the carriage rises from 0.5 m to 1 m, and its upright end is at 2.2 m. |
| `MechanismPose.ArmFollowsItsAngle` | An `Arm` whose motor starts at 90 degrees, mounted at (0.2, 0, 0.5), reports a pose with its 1 m point at (0.2, 0, 1.5). |
| `MechanismPose.PivotFollowsItsAngle` | A `Pivot` in the XY plane whose motor starts at 90 degrees points along +Y. |
| `MechanismPose.PivotTurnsInTheXyPlaneByDefault` | A `Pivot` with no `MechanismPositionConfig` of its own uses the XY plane, and at 90 degrees points along +Y, like a turret. |
| `MechanismPose.ElevatorFollowsItsHeight` | An `Elevator` mounted 0.1 m up, whose motor starts at 0.7 m, reports its carriage at 0.8 m. |
| `MechanismPose.ElevatorStages` | An elevator mounted 0.1 m up with its carriage at 0.9 m reports the right pose for each stage. Sections: cascade stages each move their share of its height (0.4, 0.7 and 1.0 m, and the last stage is the carriage pose); uneven cascade stages move in proportion to their travel; a continuous carriage moves first; a continuous carriage moves last; an elevator with only a carriage has no stage poses (both stage pose methods throw); no stages (both throw). |
| `MechanismPose.ElevatorStageHeightsAddUpToItsMaximumHeight` | `GetStageHeightTotal()` adds up the stages (1.7 m) and is empty with no stages. Stages adding up to 1 m on a 2 m elevator make the `Elevator` constructor throw with a message naming both heights. |
| `MechanismPose.ElevatorHeightIsItsStagesWithoutLimits` | An elevator with stages but no height limits gets a minimum of 0 and a maximum of the stage total (1.5 m), and reports its carriage at 0.9 m. |
| `MechanismPose.ElevatorStagesNeedAPositiveHeightForEachStage` | `WithStages()` throws `std::invalid_argument` with no stages or a 0 m stage, and three stages give `GetStages()` of 3. |
| `MechanismPose.FlyWheelFollowsItsPosition` | A `FlyWheel` whose motor starts at 90 degrees reports a pose where a point 1 m along the wheel's X axis is at (0, 0, 1). |
