# SwerveDriveTest

**Group:** [swerve-drive](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/native/cpp/mechs/SwerveDriveTest.cpp`\
**Tags:** `[SwerveDriveTest]`, `[SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest]`, `[SwerveInputStreamAimTest]`

Checks a simulated four module swerve drive: odometry, the gyro, module states and optimization, drive commands, drive to pose, anti-tipping and live tuning. It also checks `SwerveInputStream` telemetry and live tuning, and its aim options, on the same drive.

## Setup

- Eight simulated TalonFXs (a drive and an azimuth motor per module) are built once for the whole test binary and shared by every test, because Phoenix's simulation thread would crash if they were rebuilt. Before each test the fixture stops them and points the wheels forward again.
- Each test builds new modules and a new `SwerveDrive<4>` on that hardware: a 24 in square chassis, 4 in wheels, a 6.75:1 drive and 150/7:1 azimuth reduction, a gyro the test can set, 4.5 m/s and 540 deg/s maximum speeds, and translation and rotation PID controllers with a kP of 2 and 4.
- The `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest` cases give each stream its own name and write to its `Tuning` NetworkTable entries to stand in for the dashboard.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ConstructionDoesNotCrash` | The drive builds. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ConfiguredPIDControllersArePresent` | The config returns the translation (kP 2) and rotation (kP 4) controllers it was given. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.PIDControllersAreOptional` | A drive without translation and rotation controllers builds, runs telemetry and simulation, and resets its controllers without throwing. Only `DriveToPoseSetpoint` throws `SwerveDriveConfigurationException`. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.TelemetryAndSimRunWithoutCrash` | Telemetry and simulation run for 0.5 s without throwing. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.InitialPoseIsOrigin` | The starting pose is the origin, facing 0 degrees. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ResetOdometryMatchesPose` | After `ResetOdometry` to (3, 2) at 45 degrees, `GetPose()` returns that pose. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ResetOdometryAlignsGyro` | `ResetOdometry` to 90 degrees sets the gyro angle and pose heading to 90 degrees. `ZeroGyro` then sets both to 0 and keeps the position. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.GetStateFromSpeedsForwardDrive` | 1 m/s forward gives every module 1 m/s at 0 degrees. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.GetStateFromSpeedsPureRotation` | Turning in place gives every module a nonzero speed and an angle that is not forward. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.SetRobotRelativeSpeedsDoesNotCrash` | Setting robot relative speeds, moving and stopped, does not throw. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.LockPoseSetsXPattern` | `LockPose` sets the desired chassis speeds to zero, and within 0.5 s every wheel turns to point at its corner (within 10 degrees, either way round). |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ZeroGyroDoesNotCrash` | From a 45 degree heading, `ZeroGyro` does not throw and sets the pose heading to 0. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.AddVisionMeasurementDoesNotCrash` | `AddVisionMeasurement` accepts a pose without throwing. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.GetDistanceFromPose` | The distance from the origin to (3, 4) is 5 m. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DriveCommandCallsSpeedSupplier` | The `Drive` command calls its speed supplier while it runs. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DriveCommandHasSubsystemRequirement` | The `Drive` command requires the drive's subsystem. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.SecondDriveCommandInterruptsFirst` | Scheduling a second `Drive` command stops the first one calling its supplier and starts the second. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DriveToPoseSetpointIsProportionalToTheDistance` | With kP 2 and a target 5 m away at (3, 4), the setpoint is 10 m/s toward the target (6 and 8 m/s), with no turn. At the target the setpoint is zero. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DriveToPoseSetpointIsRobotRelative` | With the robot facing +Y, a target 1 m along +Y gives 2 m/s straight ahead (robot X), not sideways. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DriveToPoseKeepsDrivingUntilInterruptedAndThenStops` | `DriveToPose` toward a far target is still running and driving forward after 0.2 s. Once cancelled, the desired speed is zero. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DriveToPoseWithTolerancesEndsAtThePose` | `DriveToPose` with 5 cm and 3 degree tolerances, to a pose already within them, ends within 0.1 s and stops the drive. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.IsNearChecksDistanceAndHeading` | `IsNear` with 5 cm and 3 degrees is true 3 cm and 2 degrees away, and false 20 cm away or 10 degrees off. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.LockPoseTurnsTheWheelsEvenWithAVelocityDeadband` | With a 0.1 m/s velocity deadband on every module, `LockPose` still turns the wheels from forward to their corners. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.SetAzimuthAnglesTurnsEveryModuleEvenWithAVelocityDeadband` | With a velocity deadband, `SetAzimuthAngles(60 deg)` turns every wheel to 60 degrees (either way round) without driving it. Azimuth live tuning relies on this. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.OptimizationKeepsTheOrientationTheWheelWasSentTo` | A target 135 degrees away is reached by reversing the wheel and turning -45 degrees. A following target 80 degrees away keeps the wheel reversed (turning -100 degrees) instead of flipping back. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.GyroRotation3dMatchesTheHeading` | A heading gyro of 35 degrees gives a gyro angle and a 3D yaw of 35 degrees. A gyro given as a `Rotation3d` returns that roll, pitch and yaw. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.GyroHeadingAxisReadsTheHeadingFromRollOrPitch` | With the heading axis set to roll, pitch or yaw, a 40 degree turn on that gyro axis reads as a 40 degree heading. With roll, the 3D attitude has no roll or pitch left. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.GyroInversionAndOffsetApplyToTheHeading` | An inverted gyro reading 30 degrees with a 10 degree offset gives a heading of -40 degrees. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.AntiTippingRejectsBadValues` | `WithAntiTipping` throws `std::invalid_argument` for a zero gain, a 0 or 90 degree threshold, or a zero maximum correction, and accepts good values. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.AntiTippingCorrectsOnlyPastTheThreshold` | With a 10 degree threshold, there is no correction when level or at 5 degrees of pitch. At 20 degrees the correction is along X only and matches WPILib's `AntiTipping`, and it is added to the chassis speeds. Turning anti-tipping off removes it. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ModuleSpeedsAreDesaturated` | Without a module limit, 6 m/s passes through. With a 3 m/s module limit, driving and turning together keeps every module at or under 3 m/s. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ModuleStateOptimizationIsSetOnEveryModule` | Turning module state optimization off on the drive config turns it off on all four modules, and a target 170 degrees away is then reached the long way round instead of by reversing. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DefaultVelocityDeadbandHoldsTheWheel` | By default, a 0.05 m/s request 60 degrees away holds the wheel still at 0 speed. With the deadband off, the same request turns the wheel 60 degrees. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.CouplingRatioIsStoredAndCleared` | A 3.5 coupling ratio is stored, and the azimuth's coupled velocity is taken out of the module's measured speed. A ratio of 0 clears it. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.FeedforwardForcesNeedOnePerModule` | Setting chassis speeds with no feedforward forces or four works, and two throws `std::invalid_argument`. With four 5 N forces, the drive motor's feedforward force is 5 N. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DesiredModuleStatesAreTheOptimizedOnes` | Driving backward from forward pointing wheels gives desired states of -1 m/s at 0 degrees: the wheels are reversed, not turned. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.CosineCompensationScalar` | The cosine compensation scalar is 1 when off. When on, it is 0.5 for a 60 degree azimuth error and 0 for 120 degrees. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ModuleStateCarriesTheAzimuthVelocity` | A module's state carries the azimuth motor's velocity and the drive motor's speed. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.DriveGyroRotation3dFollowsTheHeading` | After a reset to 90 degrees, the drive's simulated 3D attitude has a 90 degree yaw and no roll or pitch. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.LowPublishesOnlyTheMode` | At `LOW` verbosity only the mode (`ANGULAR_VELOCITY`) is published: no configuration, no rotation controller inputs, no tuning entries and no Live Tuning command. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.MediumPublishesTheConfigurationReadOnly` | At `MEDIUM` verbosity the deadband, translation scale and maximum linear speed are published, but nothing is tunable. Changes made in code are published the next time the stream is read. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.HighPublishesTuningValuesAndTheLiveTuningCommand` | At `HIGH` verbosity the deadband, scales, maximum speeds, cubing and alliance and robot relative flags are published as tuning values, and a Live Tuning command is created and published. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.ReadingTheStreamPublishesTheMode` | A stream with heading control publishes `TRANSLATION_ONLY` while heading control is off and `HEADING` once it is on. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.MediumPublishesTheRotationControllerInputsWhileAligning` | The rotation controller's measurement and setpoint are NaN while driving by angular velocity. While aiming at (1, 1) the setpoint is 45 degrees. With heading control it is -90 degrees, and back to NaN when both are off. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.DashboardEditsApplyOnlyWhileLiveTuningRuns` | A deadband typed on the dashboard is applied only while the Live Tuning command runs, not before or after. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.DashboardEditsAreAppliedToTheStream` | Every tunable value (deadband, scales, maximum speeds, cubing, alliance and robot relative) is applied to the stream, stays applied on later loops, and turning a feature off on the dashboard turns it off. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.TunedValuesChangeTheOutput` | Full stick gives the drive's maximum speeds. Sections: maximum velocities override the drive config; scales; deadband (0.3 stick under a 0.5 deadband gives 0); rotation cubing (0.5 stick gives 0.125 of the maximum). |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.InvalidDashboardValuesAreReplacedWithTheStreamValue` | Bad dashboard values (negative, zero, too large, NaN or infinite deadbands, scales and maximum speeds) are replaced with the stream's value, and stay replaced on the next loop. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.CodeChangesArePublishedAndNotOverridden` | A scale changed in code, such as by a slow mode button, is published and kept, both going down and coming back up. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.CodeChangesBetweenTuningLoopsAreNotOverridden` | Two code changes to the scale in a row, each followed by a tuning loop, leave the latest value in the stream and on the dashboard. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.ValuesLeftOnTheDashboardAreReplacedWithTheStreamValues` | Values left in NetworkTables from an earlier stream with the same name are replaced by the new stream's values, not applied to it. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.SupplierControlledFeaturesAreNotOverridden` | Alliance relative control set by a supplier is published as the supplier changes, and tuning does not replace the supplier with a fixed value. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.WithTelemetryReplacesTheTelemetry` | Calling `WithTelemetry` again with a new name removes the first telemetry's entries and publishes under the new name. `NONE` turns telemetry off and removes its entries. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.CopiesClonesAndMoves` | A stream built and copied from a temporary keeps its telemetry. A `Clone()` has no telemetry. Moving a stream moves its telemetry: the moved-from stream stops publishing and the new one publishes. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.DestroyingTheStreamStopsPublishing` | When a stream with a running Live Tuning command is destroyed, its data and tuning entries and its Live Tuning entry are removed. |
| `SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.WithMaximumVelocityOverridesTheDriveConfig` | `WithMaximumLinearVelocity(2 m/s)` and `WithMaximumAngularVelocity(1 rad/s)` replace the drive's 4.5 m/s and 540 deg/s at full stick. |
| `SwerveInputStreamAimTest.AimTurnsTowardTheTarget` | Aiming at a target straight to the left asks for 4 times 90 degrees in radians (kP 4). From a robot already facing left, it asks for no turn. |
| `SwerveInputStreamAimTest.TargetVectorIsFromTheRobotToTheTarget` | From a robot at (1, 1), the target vector to (3, 4) is (2, 3). A lookahead does not change it while the robot is still. |
| `SwerveInputStreamAimTest.HeadingOffsetRotatesTheAimHeading` | A 90 degree aim heading offset with the target straight ahead asks for a 90 degree turn. The same offset, switched off by its supplier, asks for none. |
| `SwerveInputStreamAimTest.FeedforwardIsAddedToTheRotation` | An aim feedforward with a kV of 0.5 adds half of the controller's output again, in `Get()` and in `CalculateAngularVelocity`. |
| `SwerveInputStreamAimTest.AimLockIsTrueOnlyWhileAimingAndFacingTheTarget` | `IsAimLocked` is false before the stream is read, true when facing a target ahead within 1 degree, false for a target 90 degrees away unless the tolerance is 91 degrees, and false once aiming is off. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.VoltageTuningRunsWithoutTheClosedLoop` | With drive voltage tuning on at 4 V, every drive motor gets about 4 V and the wheels roll. With azimuth voltage tuning on at 1 V, every azimuth motor gets about 1 V. Turning it off holds every wheel within 2 degrees of where it stopped. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.OnlyTheHighestTuningModeStaysOn` | Turning on drive and azimuth tuning together leaves only drive tuning on. Turning on auto-align leaves only auto-align on. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.ClosedLoopPeriodIsOnTheMotorController` | The TalonFX drive and azimuth closed loops run on the motor controller, at 1 ms. |
| `SwerveDriveTest.VelocityMeasurementDelayIsSimulatedForTalons` | The drive and azimuth motors report a 1 ms velocity measurement delay, since Phoenix simulates the Talons' filtering. |
