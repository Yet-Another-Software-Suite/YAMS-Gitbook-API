# TalonWrapperParityTest

**Group:** [talon-parity](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/native/cpp/TalonWrapperParityTest.cpp`\
**Tags:** `[TalonParity]`

Checks that the C++ `TalonFXWrapper` and `TalonFXSWrapper` configure a Talon the same way the Java wrappers do: gains, slots, commutation, Motion Magic, soft limits, ramps, followers, external encoders and simulation. Each test only uses API that existed before the fixes, so it would catch the old bug. New Talon API is tested in [TalonWrapperApiTest](../motor-controllers/talon-wrapper-api-test.md).

## Setup

- Uses the shared simulated TalonFX, TalonFXS, follower TalonFX, CANcoder and CANdi from `TalonTestHardware`, reset before each test.
- The base config has a 10:1 gearing, a 40 A stator current limit, brake mode and closed loop mode. TalonFX tests drive a Kraken X60; TalonFXS tests drive a NEO.
- Values are read back from the simulated device's configuration. Phoenix simulates Talons in real time, so this group runs on its own.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `TalonParity.LinearGainsPerMechanismRotation` | An elevator with a 0.2 m circumference has its per meter gains (kP, kD, kV, kA) divided by 5 on the TalonFX, kG is kept, and gravity type is `Elevator_Static`. `SetKv` converts too, and changing the circumference rewrites the gains. |
| `TalonParity.TalonFXSLinearGainsPerMechanismRotation` | The same per meter conversion of kP and kV on a TalonFXS. |
| `TalonParity.OnlyConfiguredSlotsWritten` | YAMS writes only slot 0, where it has gains. Slot 1 keeps the kP and kV from the vendor config. |
| `TalonParity.KeepsDeviceConfigUnlessReset` | With `WithResetPreviousConfig(false)` the TalonFX keeps an earlier neutral deadband. By default the previous config is reset. |
| `TalonParity.TalonFXSCommutationAndFeedback` | A NEO sets `NEO_JST` with advanced hall support off, uses the commutation sensor as feedback, and has a sensor to mechanism ratio of 10 and rotor to sensor ratio of 1. A Minion sets `Minion_JST` with advanced hall support on. |
| `TalonParity.TalonFXSEncoderInvertedSetsSensorPhase` | An inverted encoder sets the TalonFXS sensor phase to `Opposed`, and `SetEncoderInverted(false)` sets it back to `Aligned`. |
| `TalonParity.TrapezoidProfilesUseMotionMagicRequests` | With a trapezoidal profile, `SetVelocity` sends `MotionMagicVelocityVoltage`. With a velocity trapezoidal profile, `SetPosition` sends `MotionMagicVoltage`. |
| `TalonParity.ProfileSettersUpdateConfig` | `SetMotionProfileMaxVelocity` updates the config and the cruise velocity. For a velocity profile, `SetMotionProfileMaxAcceleration` updates the acceleration (stored first) and keeps the jerk, and sets the Motion Magic acceleration. |
| `TalonParity.ExponentialProfileSetterUpdatesConfig` | `SetExponentialProfile` updates the config's kV and max input, keeps kA when not given, and sets Motion Magic Expo kV and kA. For an elevator exponential profile, the profile stays linear and kV is updated on the Talon. |
| `TalonParity.SoftLimits` | In open loop mode the soft limits are set but not enabled. `SetMechanismLimits` only moves the thresholds and does not turn them back on. A single measurement limit without the other one is not enabled. |
| `TalonParity.RampsForAllOutputTypes` | Closed and open loop ramp rates are set for duty cycle, voltage and torque outputs, and the live setters update all of them and the config. |
| `TalonParity.FollowersGetNeutralModeAndAreCleared` | A follower TalonFX gets brake mode and a `Follower` request, and the followers are cleared from the config. A follower that is not a Talon throws. |
| `TalonParity.LooseFollowersAndLiveSetters` | Setting duty cycle 0 stops a loosely coupled follower. `SetKp` updates the config and the Talon. A feedforward force is sent to the Talon and passed to the follower, and a plain velocity clears it. Changing the closed loop slot is passed to the follower. |
| `TalonParity.UnsupportedOptionsThrow` | Building a TalonFX wrapper throws for: closed loop tolerance, closed loop control period, temperature cutoff, feedback synchronization threshold, voltage compensation, encoder inverted, a slot 3 feedforward, and an unsupported control request. A TalonFXS with a slot 3 feedforward throws, and `SetClosedLoopSlot(SLOT_3)` throws. |
| `TalonParity.LinearUnitsNeedCircumference` | Without a circumference, reading or setting positions and velocities in meters throws. |
| `TalonParity.TalonFXSSetpointsInOpenLoopMode` | In open loop mode, `SetPosition` on a TalonFXS still sends a `PositionVoltage` request. |
| `TalonParity.CANcoderExternalEncoder` | A CANcoder with a 2:1 gearing, a 0.1 rotation zero offset and a starting position: an alert says the starting position is not applied, the magnet offset is 0.1, the simulated CANcoder turns twice per mechanism rotation, and `SetEncoderPosition(1.3_tr)` reads back as 1.3 mechanism rotations. |
| `TalonParity.CANdiNeedsPWMSource` | A CANdi external encoder without a PWM feedback source in the vendor config throws. |
| `TalonParity.ExternalEncoderOptionsWithoutEncoderAlert` | A zero offset without an external encoder raises an alert, and the alert clears when the wrapper is destroyed. |
| `TalonParity.Simulation` | A simulation motor the user chose (Falcon 500) is kept; a simulation is built without explicit gearing; a 5 ms simulation period sets status signals to 200 Hz. |
| `TalonParity.SetMechanismGearingUpdatesSensorRatio` | `SetMechanismGearing` to 20:1 updates the TalonFX's sensor to mechanism ratio. |
