# ArmTest

**Group:** [arm](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/java/yams/mechs/ArmTest.java`

Checks that an `Arm` and its motor controller respond to duty cycle and position commands in simulation, on every motor controller YAMS supports. It catches a motor controller or closed loop setup that leaves an arm sitting still.

## Setup

- Each parameterized test runs on 18 cases: SPARK MAX (NEO), SPARK Flex (Vortex), TalonFXS (NEO), TalonFX (Kraken X60), Nova (NEO) and A301, each with three closed loop setups: PID only, PID with a trapezoidal profile, and PID with an exponential profile.
- The shared config uses a 12:1 gearbox, a kP of 5, an `ArmFeedforward` with a kG of 1, soft limits of -100° to 100°, a 40 A stator limit and brake mode. The arm is 4 inches long with hard limits of -100° to 200°.
- The Nova gets a trapezoidal profile in its PID only case, as a Nova applies its feedforward only with a motion profile. The A301 runs on its 64:1 gearbox without current limits.
- The Talons are paced in real time, as Phoenix simulates them in real time.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `testSMCDutyCycle` | Commanding the motor controller to a 0.5 duty cycle for 1.5 s makes it move: the velocity or position changes, or the reported duty cycle is not zero. |
| `testArmDutyCycle` | The same check, through the arm's own `set(0.5)` command. |
| `testSMCPositionPID` | Commanding the motor controller to 80° for 1 s moves the arm more than 0.05°. For all but the Talons, a nonzero duty cycle while it runs also passes. |
| `testArmPositionPID` | The same check, through the arm's `setAngle(80°)` command. |
| `measurementSetpointIsEmptyWithoutACircumference` | On a SPARK MAX, after `setMechanismPositionSetpoint(20°)` the arm has a mechanism setpoint but no measurement setpoint, as an arm has no circumference to turn it into a distance. |

## Run it

From the `vendordep` folder:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "yams.mechs.ArmTest"
```
