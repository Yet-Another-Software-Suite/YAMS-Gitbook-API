# ClosedLoopGainUnitsTest

**Group:** [closed-loop-gain-units](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/java/yams/core/motorcontrollers/ClosedLoopGainUnitsTest.java`

Checks the units of the gains each motor controller is given. An `ArmFeedforward`'s kV and kA are per rotation, as YAMS documents, both on the motor controller and on the SystemCore (where WPILib's `ArmFeedforward` works in radians). A distance based controller's gains are per meter.

## Setup

- Each motor controller gets a 12:1 gearing, a 40 A stator limit, brake mode and closed loop control.
- Arm tests use kV = 1 V per rotation per second and kA = 0.5 V per rotation per second squared. Elevator tests use 0.2 m per mechanism rotation, kP = 40, kV = 8 and kA = 0.5 per meter, kS = 0.1 V and kG = 0.2 V.
- Gains are read back from the device. Talon values are checked within 0.01, since Phoenix stores them in fixed point.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `talonGetsArmGainsAsTheyAre` | A TalonFX gets the arm's kV and kA unchanged, since the Talon works per mechanism rotation. |
| `sparkGetsArmGainsPerRpmOfItsEncoder` | A SPARK MAX gets the arm's kV and kA divided by the encoder RPM of one mechanism rotation per second (12 x 60). |
| `systemCoreUsesArmGainsPerRotation` | A Nova with a fast velocity profile (run on the SystemCore) and kA = 0.05 commands about 2.5 V to reach 1 rotation per second in one 20 ms loop. Read per radian, the voltage would be 2π times larger. |
| `a301UsesArmGainsPerRotation` | The same check as `systemCoreUsesArmGainsPerRotation`, on an A301, whose closed loop always runs on the SystemCore. |
| `talonGetsElevatorGainsPerMechanismRotation` | A TalonFX gets the elevator's kP, kV and kA divided by mechanism rotations per meter (5), and kS and kG in volts. |
| `sparkGetsElevatorGainsPerEncoderRotation` | A SPARK MAX gets kP / 12 per encoder rotation, kV and kA per encoder RPM, and kS and kG in volts. |
| `novaGetsArmGainsPerMechanismRotation` | A Nova arm with kP = 8, kI = 2, kD = 0.5 and a 2 rotations per second, 4 rotations per second squared profile gets a sensor to mechanism ratio of 12 and every gain and profile value as given, per mechanism rotation, with cosine gravity. |
| `novaGetsElevatorGainsPerMechanismRotation` | A Nova elevator with a 1 m/s, 2 m/s² profile gets kP, kV and kA per mechanism rotation, a max velocity of 5 rotations per second, kS and kG in volts, and constant gravity. |
