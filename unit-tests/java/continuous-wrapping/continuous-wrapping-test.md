# ContinuousWrappingTest

**Group:** [continuous-wrapping](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/java/yams/core/motorcontrollers/ContinuousWrappingTest.java`

Checks continuous wrapping: how `SmartMotorControllerConfig` picks the setpoint nearest the current position, and that every motor controller, under every closed loop controller, crosses the wrapping point the short way in simulation. If these tests fail, a turret or swerve module can spin the long way round to reach its target.

## Setup

- Mechanisms are geared 12:1 (`3:1` then `4:1`) and wrap continuously over -0.5 to 0.5 rotations, unless noted.
- The closed loop controllers are a PID (kP 8), a trapezoidal profile, an exponential profile, and an LQR.
- Each test starts from fresh mock hardware and clears `Preferences` afterwards. The simulated devices are put back to factory defaults when a test closes them.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `setpointIsUnchangedWithoutContinuousWrapping` | Without continuous wrapping, `getContinuousWrappingSetpoint` returns the setpoint unchanged (0.45 rotations stays 0.45). |
| `setpointIsTheEquivalentNearestTheCurrentPosition` | With continuous wrapping, the setpoint becomes the equivalent angle nearest the current position: across the wrapping point (0.45 from -0.45 gives -0.55, and -0.4 from 0.4 gives 0.6), several rotations away (0.1 from 2.0 gives 2.1), and unchanged when it is already nearest. |
| `wrappingIsNotContinuous` | `withWrapping` sets the wrapping min and max but is not continuous: the PID does not get continuous input, the setpoint is not moved, and soft limits are allowed. `withContinuousWrapping` turns on continuous input, and a later `withWrapping` turns it off again. Soft limits together with continuous wrapping, in either order, throw `SmartMotorControllerConfigurationException`. |
| `pidControllerSetAfterContinuousWrappingWraps` | A closed loop controller set after `withContinuousWrapping` still has continuous input enabled. |
| `simulationPidControllerWraps` | The simulation closed loop controller has continuous input enabled, whether it is set before or after `withContinuousWrapping`. |
| `continuousWrappingWorksWithAnLqrController` | Adding continuous wrapping to a config with an LQR controller does not throw. |
| `sparkWrapsOverTheMechanismRangeInFeedbackSensorRotations` | On a SPARK MAX, YAMS enables onboard position wrapping and sets its range in rotations of the feedback sensor: -6 to 6 when the motor's encoder closes the loop (12 turns per mechanism rotation), and -0.5 to 0.5 when the absolute encoder on the mechanism does. Runs with no external encoder, with the absolute encoder set but not used for feedback, and with it used for feedback. |
| `sparkDoesNotWrapWithoutContinuousWrapping` | A SPARK MAX that starts with position wrapping on has it turned off by YAMS when the config has no continuous wrapping. Runs over the same three encoder setups. |
| `crossesTheWrappingPointTheShortWay` | Each mechanism moves to 170°, then to -170°. It must reach both within 5°, and never come within 90° of 0° on the second move, so it went through the wrapping point and not the long way round. Runs under all four closed loop controllers, for SPARK MAX, SPARK Flex, TalonFX, TalonFXS, Nova and A301, each with and without an attached encoder (a SPARK's or A301's absolute encoder, a CANcoder on a Talon, a Nova's absolute encoder). It also runs a Through Bore Encoder on each SPARK (quadrature and over CAN), a CANdi on each Talon, a Nova with a Thrifty CAN Encoder, and, for the exponential profile and LQR only, a Nova with a quadrature encoder. Nova cases with an absolute encoder wrap over 0 to 1 rotation. |
