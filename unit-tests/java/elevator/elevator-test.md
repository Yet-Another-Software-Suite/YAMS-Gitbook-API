# ElevatorTest

**Group:** [elevator](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/java/yams/mechs/ElevatorTest.java`

Checks that an `Elevator` and its motor controller respond to duty cycle and height commands in simulation, on every motor controller YAMS supports. It also checks that the elevator turns a height setpoint into drum rotations correctly.

## Setup

- Each parameterized test runs on 18 cases: SPARK MAX (NEO), SPARK Flex (Vortex), TalonFXS (NEO), TalonFX (Kraken X60), Nova (NEO) and A301, each with three closed loop setups: PID only, PID with a trapezoidal profile, and PID with an exponential profile.
- The shared config uses a drum circumference of 5.5 inches (22 teeth at 0.25 inch), a 12:1 gearbox, a kP of 30 V per meter, soft limits of 0 m to 5 m, a 40 A stator limit and brake mode. The elevator has a 16 lb carriage and hard limits of 0 m to 3 m.
- The Nova gets a trapezoidal profile in its PID only case, as a Nova applies its feedforward only with a motion profile. The A301 runs on its 64:1 gearbox without current limits.
- The Talons are paced in real time, as Phoenix simulates them in real time.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `testSMCDutyCycle` | Commanding the motor controller to full duty cycle for 1 s raises the velocity or the height, or the reported duty cycle is not zero. |
| `testSMCPositionPID` | Commanding the motor controller to 2 m for 1 s moves it more than 5 mm. For all but the Talons, a nonzero duty cycle while it runs also passes. |
| `testElevatorDutyCycle` | The duty cycle check, through the elevator's own `set(1)` command. |
| `testElevatorPositionPID` | The position check, through the elevator's `setHeight(2 m)` command. |
| `measurementSetpointIsTheMechanismSetpointAsADistance` | On a SPARK MAX, the measurement setpoint is empty until a position is set. After `setMeasurementPositionSetpoint(0.5 m)` it reads 0.5 m, and the mechanism setpoint is 0.5 m divided by the circumference, in rotations. |

## Run it
