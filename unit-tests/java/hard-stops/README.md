# hard-stops

A pivot driven into its hard stops, and a Talon set to a position, on every motor controller.

## Test classes

| Test class | Tests | What it checks |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------- |
| [HardStopTest](hard-stop-test.md) | 4 | Checks that a simulated pivot stays on its hard stops on every motor controller, that a Talon keeps a set encoder position, and that starting positions and continuous wrapping behave. |
