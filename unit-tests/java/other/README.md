Everything else: swerve config, mechanism poses, the battery simulation and the standalone math tests.

## Test classes

| Test class | Tests | What it checks |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------- |
| [MechanismPoseTest](mechanism-pose-test.md) | 20 | Checks each mechanism's 3D pose and multi stage elevator stage poses against poses worked out by hand. |
| [SwerveDriveAntiTippingTest](swerve-drive-anti-tipping-test.md) | 8 | Checks the anti tipping correction's threshold, direction, cap, how it is added to chassis speeds, and invalid settings. |
| [SwerveDriveGyroAxisTest](swerve-drive-gyro-axis-test.md) | 7 | Checks that a side mounted gyro's heading, inversion, offset and tilt are rotated into the robot's frame. |
| [SwerveModuleConfigTest](swerve-module-config-test.md) | 6 | Checks swerve module optimization: quarter turn limit, hysteresis against flipping, and holding the wheel below the velocity deadband. |
| [BatterySimTest](battery-sim-test.md) | 9 | Checks the simulated battery's sag, drain, charge curve, capacity derating and thread safety under heavy load from six motor controllers. |
| [MechanismBatterySimTest](mechanism-battery-sim-test.md) | 1 | Checks that an idle Arm, Elevator, Pivot or FlyWheel simIterate does not wipe out battery sag from the rest of the robot. |
| [ChineseRemainderTheoremTest](chinese-remainder-theorem-test.md) | 9 | Checks EasyCRT solving a position over several rotations from two absolute encoders, including backlash, bad readings and invalid setups. |
| [RunToSupplierTest](run-to-supplier-test.md) | 2 | Checks that runTo with a supplier follows a changing target and ends only near the current one. |

## Run the group
