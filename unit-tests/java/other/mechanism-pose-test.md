# MechanismPoseTest

**Group:** [other](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/java/yams/core/mechanisms/MechanismPoseTest.java`

Checks each mechanism's `getPose3d()` against poses worked out by hand: where it is mounted, how its motor's position turns or moves it, in each movement plane, on a turned mount, and on another mechanism. It also checks the stage poses of multi stage elevators.

## Setup

- The first six tests use `MechanismPositionConfig` alone, with no motor controllers.
- The rest build each mechanism on a SPARK MAX with 10:1 gearing, set to a starting position, and read its pose without running the simulation.
- Elevator stage tests mount the elevator 0.1 m up with the carriage at 0.9 m.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `anArmInTheXzPlaneTurnsUpTowardZ` | An arm mounted at (0.2, 0, 0.5) points forward at 0°, straight up at 90°, and forward and down at -30°. |
| `anArmInTheYzPlaneTurnsFromYUpTowardZ` | In the YZ plane, an arm points along +Y at 0° and along +Z at 90°. |
| `aTurretInTheXyPlaneTurnsFromXTowardY` | In the XY plane, a turret turned 90° points along +Y, and turned 180° points along -X. |
| `anElevatorSlidesAlongItsAngle` | An upright elevator's carriage at 0.7 m is 0.7 m above the mount and does not turn. An elevator at 60° (leaning 30° forward) moves the carriage forward and up along that angle. |
| `aTurnedMountTurnsTheMechanism` | An arm on a mount turned 90° to face left points to the left at 0° and up at 90°. |
| `aMechanismOnAnotherMovesWithIt` | An arm mounted on an elevator's carriage moves up with the carriage as it rises, and its end follows. |
| `anArmsPoseFollowsItsAngle` | An `Arm` at 90° points straight up from its mount. |
| `aPivotsPoseFollowsItsAngle` | A `Pivot` in the XY plane at 90° points along +Y. |
| `aPivotTurnsInTheXyPlaneByDefault` | A `Pivot` with no movement plane set turns in the XY plane. |
| `anElevatorsPoseFollowsItsHeight` | An `Elevator` mounted 0.1 m up with its carriage at 0.7 m puts the carriage 0.8 m up. |
| `aCascadeElevatorsStagesEachMoveTheirShareOfItsHeight` | With three equal stages, `getCascadePose3d` puts them at a third, two thirds and all of the carriage's height. The last stage is the carriage's pose. |
| `aCascadeElevatorsStagesMoveInProportionToTheirTravel` | With stages of 0.6, 0.3 and 0.3 m, the first stage moves half the carriage's height and the others a quarter each. |
| `aContinuousElevatorsCarriageMovesFirst` | With `getContinuousPose3d(true)` and three 0.5 m stages, the carriage moves its first 0.5 m, the second stage the other 0.4 m, and the first stage does not move. |
| `aContinuousElevatorsCarriageMovesLast` | With `getContinuousPose3d(false)`, the first stage moves its 0.5 m first, then the second stage the other 0.4 m, and the carriage does not move on the second stage. |
| `anElevatorWithOnlyACarriageHasNoStagePoses` | An elevator with one stage throws `ElevatorConfigurationException` for cascade and continuous stage poses, but still has a carriage pose. |
| `elevatorStagesNeedAPositiveHeightForEachStage` | `withStages()` with no heights, or with a 0 m height, throws `IllegalArgumentException`. Three heights give three stages. An elevator with no stages throws `ElevatorConfigurationException` for stage poses. |
| `anElevatorsHeightIsItsStagesWithoutHardLimits` | With no hard limits, three 0.5 m stages give a maximum height of 1.5 m and a minimum of 0, and the carriage pose follows the motor. |
| `elevatorStageHeightsAddUpToItsMaximumHeight` | Stage heights of 0.6, 0.6 and 0.5 m total 1.7 m, and no stages give no total. Stages adding up to 1 m on a 2 m elevator throw `ElevatorConfigurationException` with a message saying so. |
| `aFlywheelsPoseFollowsItsPosition` | A `FlyWheel` turned 90° turns a point on the wheel from +X to +Z. |
| `aDoubleJointedArmsUpperArmIsAtTheEndOfItsLowerArm` | On a `DoubleJointedArm` with the lower arm up and the upper arm level, the upper arm's pivot is at the lower arm's end (the elbow) and the upper arm points forward from it. |
