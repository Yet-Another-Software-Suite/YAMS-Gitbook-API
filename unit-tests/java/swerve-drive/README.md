# swerve-drive

Four module swerve drives on a Pigeon2, with many mixes of motor controllers, and SwerveInputStream aiming and telemetry for Commands v2 and v3.

## Test classes

| Test class | Tests | What it checks |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------- |
| [SwerveDriveTest](swerve-drive-test.md) | 33 | Drives a simulated four module swerve on 9 motor controller layouts and checks driving, spinning, odometry, gyro, live tuning, closed loop placement and its commands. |
| [SwerveInputStreamAimTest (Commands v2)](swerve-input-stream-aim-test-commands2.md) | 8 | Checks the SwerveInputStream aim options: lookahead, heading offset, feedforward, aim lock and clone. |
| [SwerveInputStreamAimTest (Commands v3)](swerve-input-stream-aim-test-commands3.md) | 8 | Same aim tests on Commands v3, except the aimLock trigger is not checked because a v3 trigger only updates when the scheduler polls it. |
| [SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest (Commands v2)](swerve-input-stream-telemetry-test-commands2.md) | 20 | Checks what each telemetry verbosity publishes and how live tuning applies, rejects and keeps SwerveInputStream values. |
| [SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest (Commands v3)](swerve-input-stream-telemetry-test-commands3.md) | 20 | Same telemetry and live tuning tests on Commands v3, with Live Tuning run on the v3 Scheduler. |
