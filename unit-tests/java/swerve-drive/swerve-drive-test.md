# SwerveDriveTest

**Group:** [swerve-drive](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/java/yams/mechs/SwerveDriveTest.java`

Drives a simulated four module swerve drive (`yams.commands2.swerve.SwerveDrive`) and checks that it moves, turns, keeps its odometry and gyro in agreement, live tunes, and runs its commands. The motor tests run on many mixes of motor controllers, so a team can trust the same swerve code whatever hardware its modules use. It is a port of the C++ `SwerveDriveTest`.

## Setup

- Each drive is a 24 in by 24 in square chassis with 4 in wheels, a 6.75:1 drive and a 12.8:1 azimuth, and reads its attitude from a simulated Pigeon2. It has a translation controller of kP 2 and a rotation controller of kP 4, and a maximum speed of 4.5 m/s and 540 deg/s.
- Parameterized tests run on 9 layouts (drive/azimuth motor controller per module): TalonFX drive with SPARK MAX azimuth; SPARK MAX drive with TalonFX azimuth; two mixes pairing SPARK MAX, SPARK Flex, TalonFXS and TalonFX as different drive and azimuth controllers (each way round); a mix where each module uses one of SPARK MAX, SPARK Flex, TalonFXS or TalonFX for both; all Nova; Nova mixed with the others; all A301; and SPARK MAX, SPARK Flex, TalonFXS and TalonFX drives with A301 azimuths.
- An A301 module adds a 3:1 gearbox to the drive and a 13.5:1 gearbox to the azimuth, with higher gains to match its smaller motor. A Nova azimuth uses a Thrifty CAN Encoder as its feedback, wrapped over 0 to 1 rotation.
- Phoenix keeps simulating every CTRE device a run creates, so each layout's hardware is built once for the class and only the `SwerveDrive` is rebuilt per test. After each test the wheels are brought to a stop. Each loop sleeps 20 ms so Phoenix, which simulates Talons in real time, can keep up.

## Tests

Tests that are not parameterized use the TalonFX drive, SPARK MAX azimuth layout.

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `telemetryAndSimRunWithoutCrash` | Telemetry and simulation run for 0.5 s without throwing. Runs on every layout. |
| `configReadsThePigeon2` | With the simulated Pigeon2 set to 30° yaw and 5° pitch, the config's gyro attitude reads both within 0.5°. Runs on every layout. |
| `drivesForward` | Driving at 1 m/s forward for 2 s moves the robot more than 1 m forward, less than 0.1 m sideways, turns it less than 5°, and ends at 1 m/s (within 0.2). The modules stay within 0.25 m/s of moving as one rigid body. Runs on every layout. |
| `spinsInPlace` | Spinning at 2 rad/s ends at that speed (within 0.4), moves less than 0.1 m and turns more than 20° after the modules settle, with the modules not fighting. Runs on every layout. |
| `translatesWhileSpinning` | Driving field relative toward +X at 1 m/s while spinning at 2 rad/s moves more than 0.5 m along +X, spins at 2 rad/s (within 0.4), translates at 1 m/s (within 0.3), with the modules not fighting. Runs on every layout. |
| `resetOdometryAlignsGyro` | `resetOdometry` to 90° sets both the gyro heading and the pose heading to 90°. `zeroGyro` then sets both to 0° and keeps the pose's X. Runs on every layout. |
| `lockPoseSetsXPattern` | `lockPose` asks for zero chassis speed, and after 1 s every wheel points along its module's location from the robot center (within 10°, either way round). Runs on every layout. |
| `setAzimuthAnglesTurnsEveryModule` | `setAzimuthAngles(60°)` turns every wheel to 60° (within 10°, either way round) without driving, even though zero speed is inside the velocity deadband. Runs on every layout. |
| `driveVoltageTuningDrivesTheWheelsWithoutTheirClosedLoop` | Live tuning a 4 V drive voltage gives every drive motor 4 V (within 0.25), drives each wheel forward faster than 0.5 m/s, and keeps it pointed forward. Turning the voltage off brings the wheels back to rest on their closed loop, and they then follow a 1 m/s velocity setpoint. Runs on every layout. |
| `azimuthVoltageTuningTurnsTheWheelsWithoutTheirClosedLoop` | Live tuning a 1 V azimuth voltage gives every azimuth motor 1 V (within 0.25) and turns each wheel faster than 10 deg/s. Turning the voltage and azimuth tuning off holds each wheel within 2° of where it stopped. Runs on every layout. |
| `onlyTheHighestTuningModeStaysOn` | With drive and azimuth tuning both turned on, azimuth tuning is turned back off. Turning on auto-align then turns both drive and azimuth tuning off. |
| `closedLoopPeriodIsWhereTheClosedLoopRuns` | Each drive motor's closed loop period is 0.02 s on a Nova or A301 (run on the SystemCore) and 0.001 s on every other motor controller. Runs on every layout. |
| `velocityMeasurementDelayIsSimulatedForTalons` | Each drive and azimuth motor's velocity measurement delay is 0.001 s on a TalonFX or TalonFXS and 0.02 s on every other motor controller. Runs on every layout. |
| `configuredPIDControllersArePresent` | The config returns the translation controller (kP 2) and rotation controller (kP 4) it was given. |
| `pidControllersAreOptional` | A config without translation or rotation controllers reports them missing. A drive built from it updates telemetry, simulates, and resets its controllers without throwing, and only `driveToPoseSetpoint` throws `SwerveDriveConfigurationException`. |
| `initialPoseIsTheStartingPose` | A new drive's pose and gyro heading are at the origin, facing 0°. |
| `resetOdometryMatchesPose` | After `resetOdometry` to (3, 2, 45°), the pose matches. |
| `gyroHeadingWrapsAtHalfARotation` | Resetting to 270° gives a gyro heading and pose heading of -90°. |
| `fieldRelativeSpeedsUseTheGyroHeading` | Facing 90°, a field relative 1 m/s toward +X becomes a robot relative 1 m/s to the robot's right (vy of -1). |
| `stateFromSpeedsForwardDrive` | Module states for 1 m/s forward have every wheel at 1 m/s, pointing forward. |
| `stateFromSpeedsPureRotation` | Module states for a pure rotation have every wheel moving and none pointing forward. |
| `setRobotRelativeSpeedsDoesNotCrash` | `setRobotRelativeChassisSpeeds` with a moving and a zero speed does not throw. |
| `addVisionMeasurementDoesNotCrash` | `addVisionMeasurement` does not throw. |
| `distanceFromPose` | From the origin, the distance to (3, 4) is 5 m. |
| `angleDifferenceFromPoseWrapsAtHalfARotation` | Facing 170°, the angle difference to a pose at -170° is 20° once wrapped. |
| `driveCommandCallsSpeedSupplier` | The `drive` command calls its speed supplier while it runs. |
| `driveCommandRequiresTheSubsystem` | The `drive` command requires the drive's subsystem, and `getSubsystem` returns it. |
| `secondDriveCommandInterruptsFirst` | Scheduling a second `drive` command runs it and stops the first one from calling its supplier. |
| `isNearChecksDistanceAndHeading` | `isNear` is true within 5 cm and 3°, false 20 cm away, and false 10° off. |
| `stopBringsTheDriveToRest` | After driving forward faster than 0.5 m/s, `stop` brings the forward speed to 0 (within 0.1) in 1 s. |
| `driveToPoseRequiresTheSubsystem` | Both `driveToPose` overloads, with and without tolerances, require the drive's subsystem. |
| `driveToPoseWithTolerancesEndsAtThePoseAndStops` | `driveToPose` to 0.75 m with 10 cm and 5° tolerances is still running after 0.1 s, ends within 5 s near the pose (within 15 cm and 5°), and the robot then comes to rest. |
| `driveToPoseWithoutTolerancesRunsUntilInterruptedAndStops` | `driveToPose` to a pose 30 m away with no tolerances is still running and driving forward faster than 0.3 m/s after 1.5 s. Cancelling it brings the robot to rest. |
