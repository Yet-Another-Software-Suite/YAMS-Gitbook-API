# SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest (Commands v2)

**Group:** [swerve-drive](README.md)\
**Source:** `vendordep/src/test/java/yams/commands2/telemetry/SwerveInputStreamTelemetryTest.java`

Checks `SwerveInputStream.withTelemetry` in Commands v2: what each `TelemetryVerbosity` publishes, that reading the stream publishes it, and live tuning at `HIGH`. Valid dashboard edits change the stream's output while the Live Tuning command runs, invalid edits are replaced with the stream's value, and changes made in code are published without being overridden. The [Commands v3 version](swerve-input-stream-telemetry-test-commands3.md) runs the same tests.

## Setup

- A simulated four module drive on SPARK MAX motor controllers, built once for the class since the streams only read it. It has a maximum speed of 4.5 m/s and 540 deg/s, and a rotation controller.
- Each test names its stream uniquely and closes its telemetry afterward. Writing to a tuning entry from the test stands in for the dashboard, and one call to `applyTuningValues` stands in for one loop of the Live Tuning command.

## Tests

| Test | What it checks |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `lowPublishesOnlyTheMode` | At `LOW` the stream publishes its mode (`ANGULAR_VELOCITY`), but not its deadband or rotation controller inputs. Nothing is published for tuning and there is no Live Tuning command. |
| `midPublishesTheConfigurationReadOnly` | At `MID` the stream publishes its deadband, translation scale and maximum linear velocity, but nothing for tuning and no Live Tuning command. A scale changed in code is published the next time the stream is read. |
| `highPublishesTuningValuesAndTheLiveTuningCommand` | At `HIGH` the tuning table shows the deadband, translation and rotation scales, maximum linear and angular velocities, translation and rotation cubing, and alliance and robot relative control, matching the stream. The Live Tuning command exists and is on the dashboard. |
| `readingTheStreamPublishesTheMode` | Reading a stream with heading control turned on publishes the `HEADING` mode. |
| `midPublishesTheRotationControllerInputsWhileAligning` | At `MID`, while driving by angular velocity, the rotation controller's measurement and setpoint are not published and the getters are empty. Aiming at (1, 1) from the origin publishes a measurement of 0 and a setpoint of π/4 rad, and the getters return them. Heading control to -90° publishes a setpoint of -π/2. Turning both off clears them again. |
| `dashboardEditsApplyOnlyWhileLiveTuningRuns` | A deadband edited on the dashboard is not applied before Live Tuning runs, is applied while it runs, and later edits are not applied after it stops. |
| `dashboardEditsAreAppliedToTheStream` | Dashboard edits to every tuning value (deadband, scales, maximum velocities, cubing, alliance and robot relative) are applied to the stream, stay applied on later loops, and turning a feature off on the dashboard turns it off in the stream. |
| `tunedMaximumVelocitiesOverrideTheDriveConfig` | Full stick gives the drive's 4.5 m/s. Tuned maximums of 2 m/s and 3 rad/s replace the drive's in the output. |
| `tunedDeadbandChangesTheOutput` | A stick at 0.3 drives forward, and a tuned deadband of 0.5 brings the output to 0. |
| `tunedScalesChangeTheOutput` | Tuned translation and rotation scales of 0.5 and 0.25 scale the full stick output by the same amounts. |
| `tunedCubingChangesTheOutput` | Tuned rotation cubing turns a 0.5 rotation stick into 0.125 of the maximum angular velocity. |
| `invalidDashboardValuesAreReplacedWithTheStreamValue` | An invalid dashboard value is replaced with the stream's value and the stream is unchanged. Runs over 12 cases: deadband of -0.1, 1.0 and NaN; translation scale of 0 and 1.5; rotation scale of -0.5 and NaN; maximum linear velocity of 0, -1 and Infinity; maximum angular velocity of 0 and NaN. |
| `codeChangesArePublishedAndNotOverridden` | A translation scale changed in code (as by a slow mode binding) is published and kept by the next tuning loop, and so is changing it back. |
| `codeChangesBetweenTuningLoopsAreNotOverridden` | Two code changes in a row, each followed by a tuning loop, leave the stream and the dashboard at the last one. |
| `valuesLeftOnTheDashboardAreReplacedWithTheStreamValues` | Values left on the dashboard before the telemetry starts (as by an earlier telemetry with the same name) are replaced with the stream's, and tuning does not apply them. |
| `supplierControlledFeaturesAreNotOverridden` | A feature set by a supplier (alliance relative control) is published as the supplier changes, and tuning does not replace the supplier with a fixed value. |
| `withTelemetryReplacesTheTelemetry` | Calling `withTelemetry` again under a new name replaces the telemetry, closes the first one's data and tuning entries, and publishes under the new name. |
| `cloneHasNoTelemetry` | A clone has no telemetry while the original keeps its own, and a stream has no telemetry until `withTelemetry` is called. |
| `closeStopsPublishing` | Closing the telemetry cancels the running Live Tuning command and removes the published data, tuning entries and Live Tuning from the dashboard. |
| `withMaximumVelocityOverridesTheDriveConfig` | Without telemetry, the stream defaults to the drive's maximum speed, and `withMaximumLinearVelocity` and `withMaximumAngularVelocity` replace it in the output. |

## Run it
